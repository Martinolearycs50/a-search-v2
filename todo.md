# TODO

## = Bug Fixes
- [x] Fix URL validation bug where valid URLs (e.g., www.tap.company) were rejected
- [x] Prevent form submission from navigating to new page
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling for production environment
- [ ] Fix ESLint warnings in codebase (see lint output)
- [ ] Handle edge cases for URLs with authentication (user:pass@domain)

## =ï¿½ Features

### High Priority
- [x] Implement content-aware recommendations based on actual website content (COMPLETED - v2.4.0)
- [ ] Implement Redis-based rate limiting for production (currently using in-memory)
- [ ] Add URL analysis history/cache to avoid re-analyzing same URLs
- [ ] Implement batch URL analysis capability
- [ ] Add export functionality for analysis reports (PDF/CSV)
- [ ] Create API documentation page

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Add more AI platforms to analysis (Bing Chat, Bard, etc.)
- [ ] Implement real-time analysis progress updates via WebSocket
- [x] Add comparison mode to analyze multiple URLs side-by-side (COMPLETED - v2.1.0)
- [ ] Create browser extension for quick analysis
- [ ] Add webhook support for automated analysis

### Low Priority
- [ ] Add dark/light theme toggle
- [ ] Implement user accounts for saving analysis history
- [ ] Add internationalization (i18n) support
- [ ] Create mobile app version
- [ ] Add A/B testing for recommendations

## <ï¿½ UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Add loading skeleton screens instead of spinner
- [ ] Implement keyboard navigation for results
- [ ] Add copy-to-clipboard for recommendations
- [ ] Create interactive tutorial for first-time users
- [ ] Add tooltips for technical terms

## >ï¿½ Testing
- [ ] Add integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Create E2E tests with Playwright/Cypress
- [ ] Add visual regression tests for UI components
- [ ] Implement performance benchmarks
- [ ] Add accessibility (a11y) tests

## =ï¿½ Performance
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries for React components
- [ ] Add service worker for offline functionality
- [ ] Optimize bundle size (code splitting, tree shaking)
- [ ] Implement image optimization for screenshots
- [ ] Add CDN for static assets

## = Security
- [ ] Add CSRF protection
- [ ] Implement proper API authentication
- [ ] Add request signing for API calls
- [ ] Set up security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- [ ] Regular dependency vulnerability scanning

## =ï¿½ Documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to all functions
- [ ] Create architecture decision records (ADRs)
- [ ] Write deployment guide
- [ ] Add contributing guidelines

## <ï¿½ Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- [ ] Configure monitoring and alerting (Sentry, LogRocket)
- [ ] Implement database for analysis history
- [ ] Set up staging environment
- [ ] Add Docker support

## =' Code Quality
- [ ] Refactor analyzer.ts to be more modular
- [ ] Extract magic numbers to constants
- [ ] Improve TypeScript types (remove 'any' types)
- [ ] Add proper logging system
- [ ] Implement dependency injection

## Known Issues
1. Rate limiting is reset on server restart (in-memory storage)
2. Large websites may timeout during analysis
3. Some schema markup formats may not be detected
4. Mobile responsiveness check is basic
5. No retry mechanism for failed API requests

## Future Considerations
- Implement AI-powered suggestions using GPT-4
- Add competitor analysis features
- Create WordPress/CMS plugins
- Build API SDK for different languages
- Consider microservices architecture for scaling
